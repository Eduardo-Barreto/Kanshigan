// TODO: Expandir

We presented Kanshigan, the first computer vision pipeline for automated analysis of Robot Sumo matches. Our contributions include a publicly available annotated dataset, a comparative benchmark of detection and tracking approaches, and a set of standardized performance metrics for the domain. (TODO: summarize key experimental findings).

Future work includes extending the pipeline to real-time processing for live broadcast augmentation, expanding the dataset to additional weight classes and competition formats, and integrating Kanshigan as the analytical engine for a collaborative platform for robot combat statistics.
