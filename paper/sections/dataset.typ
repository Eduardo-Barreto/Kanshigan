== Collection

We collected match videos from two primary sources: broadcasts of the All Japan Robot Sumo Tournament and recordings from Brazilian competitions. All videos feature 3kg autonomous category matches. Videos vary in quality from professional multi-camera broadcasts to single-camera amateur recordings, captured from varying angles (overhead, diagonal, lateral).

== Annotation

// TODO: Descrever processo de anotação semi-automática

We employed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline to minimize manual labeling effort. (TODO: detail annotation tool and process). Annotations include bounding boxes for robots and dohyo boundaries, as well as temporal event labels (round start, first contact, ring-out, round end) with corresponding outcome labels (which side won).
